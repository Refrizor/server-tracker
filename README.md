# ServerTracker

**ServerTracker** is a system for tracking Minecraft server uptime and player sessions. It includes a backend API (Node.js + TypeScript) and a Spigot plugin that registers servers, sends heartbeats, and reports player activity. Redis and MySQL are used to store both volatile and persistent data.

This project is organized into two main modules:
- `api/`: Handles server registration, heartbeats, and downtime tracking.
- `plugin/`: A Spigot plugin that tracks server and player state and communicates with the API.

> **Note**: This is a working proof-of-concept. It will be worked on over time.

## Features

- Server registration with persistent metadata (name, version, environment, etc.)
- Heartbeat system using Redis with expiring keys for live state tracking
- Player session tracking (includes `uuid`, `username`, `joinedAt`, `vanished`)
- Global player count aggregation and Redis pub/sub distribution -> sends to Spigot to cache.
- - Useful for lobby sidebars in displaying the player count without hitting the API
- Scheduled downtime detection based on heartbeat timeouts
- Asynchronous, modular plugin built with Guice

## What This Is Not

- _Not_ meant to be a plug-and-play â€” setup is required
- No metrics system (yet)
- Built as a foundation for future expansion

## Requirements
Tech stack is shown below, but of course, the following is required:
1. MySQL database server,
2. Redis server
3. Spigot server on 1.21.5
